# IOT-project
This project sends Arduino sensor data to a Node.js server, which establishes a real-time connection with a locally hosted web page. Using Chart.js, the web page displays the data on a dynamic line graph. It enables easy monitoring and visualization of Arduino data for applications such as environmental monitoring and industrial automation.
